## Tic-Tac-Toe Game: A JavaScript Challenge

This repository contains a functional Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The code is well-structured, commented, and easy to understand, making it a great project for beginners to learn web development fundamentals.

**Features:**

* Players take turns marking the board with "X" or "O".
* Winning combinations are detected and the winner is declared.
* A draw is announced if all squares are filled without a winner.
* A reset button allows players to start a new game.
* A new game button is included for future implementation (currently resets the game).
